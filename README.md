# Heliostat
Operation get-sun-grow-vegetables for our backyard

Thought process - requirements:
- need to control movement up, down, left right (2 axes)
- need to waterproof controllers
- think about usage dates and subsequent power requirements/ need for ease of installation (assuming take down near frost dates in fall - spring not needed as no leaves yet on trees around frost dates?)
- need to take down/colapse if high wind/ tornado weather forecasted
- convex mirror 
- ability to control remotely on regular intervals to set sun curve (perhaps a joy stick app with commit button) (override for next day's onboard program, but keep current in system for anaylsis and future curve fitting) This means arudino may be out, raspberry pi with wifi may be better
- need to check wifi range 
-  is laundry line going to impact line of sight
